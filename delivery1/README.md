# NLP


Summary:
Our goal with this project is to build NLP classifiers that can distinguish a textâ€™s underlying emotion.

Steps:
1. Understand the provenance and characteristics of the data:
  [origin.md](origin.md)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis typical of ML projects:
  [eda.ipynb](eda.ipynb)
3. Preprocess and feature representation (sparse and/or dense - justify):
  [Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb](Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb)
4. Evaluate classifiers and try to understand the causes of errors:
  [Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb](Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb)
5. Refine/compare classifiers:
  [Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb](Emotion_Class_Model.ipynb)
